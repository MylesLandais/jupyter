You know, I can't really blame you since I was flirting with you all night.  You really should know the only reason I flirt with guys like you is to get a big fat tip.  And then I opened my book at the end of the night, and I see you only left me five bucks.  You think I show off my body like this just to, you know, like, have fun? No. I want your money.  Can't you get that into your big fat head?  So, you know, sitting at home thinking, what am I going to do about this?  Like, I need your money. That's why I work at Hooters. That's why I flirt with guys like you all day.  I need more than five bucks to pay the rent.  So, since you left your number, I knew you'd have no problem with me coming over to your house.  And I thought, I can just tease the shit out of you until I get what I know I rightfully deserve.  And you can handle it, loser. You only have one chance to say no.  Ready? Set, go.  I swear, boys like you are so stupid. You think you can resist this again?  You think I can't get more cash out of you, huh?  I know you come into here all the time looking for hot girls like me, right?  And I know you've been watching me hoping that I be your waitress.  And I finally was, and how do you repay me?  Five bucks.  I can fix that. You like that ass, don't you? I caught you staring at it.  Why do you get a closer look, loser?  Huh?  Want me to just smother you with my nice tight ass?  Yeah, that's what you want, isn't it?  You like those hooter shorts right in your fucking face?  You better use to it, loser, because all that money is gonna be mine real soon.  I'm sure you're never gonna walk into hooters the same way.  Ever again, are you? Nope. You're not gonna be a cheapo anymore.  You're gonna make sure you tip me and my friends real good on you.  Because you know that's what we deserve, because we're hot.  And you're not.  So what do you think you like more loser?  My nice ass?  Or my big round hooters.  Huh? What do you think you like more loser?  You like being teased by me?  You know, all that money seems gonna be mine, and you're never ever gonna leave a five dollar tip again, are you?  Nope.  And until you right now, you're not.  I swear, boys like you are so stupid.  You think you can resist this again?  You think I can't get more cash out of you, huh?  I know you come into hooters all the time.  Looking for hot girls like me, right?  And I know you've been watching me hoping that I be your waitress.  And I finally was.  And how do you repay me?  Five bucks.  I can fix that.  You like that ass, don't you?  I caught you staring at it.  Why don't you get a closer look loser, huh?  Want me to just smother you with my nice tight ass?  Yeah, that's what you want, isn't it?  You like those hooters shorts right in your fucking face?  You better use to it, loser, because all that money is gonna be mine real soon.  I'm sure you're never gonna walk into hooters the same way.  Ever again, are you?  Nope.  You're not gonna be a cheap one anymore.  You're gonna make sure you tip me and my friends real good on you.  Because you know that's what we deserve, because we're hot.  And you're not.  So what do you think you like more loser?  My nice ass, or my big round hooters.  Huh?  What do you think you like more loser?  You like being teased by me?  You know, all that money seems gonna be mine.  And you're never, ever gonna leave a five dollar tip again, are you?  Nope.  Until you right now, you're not.  You like these panty hoes too, don't you loser?  Yeah?  I got you staring at my legs in them.  So easy to get all your money loser.  I don't know why you tried to resist in the first place.  And then you just let me five bucks on purpose, because you knew I'd show up to Mandy more, right?  Right, loser?  Yeah, you and your loser friends come into who knows all the time just stare at us.  And we know that we can get all your cash in a matter of minutes.  And I can guarantee you right now, loser.  It's not gonna take long.  Let's see, what's this?  Does your checkbook?  You know, you probably shouldn't leave things like this out when you know I'm coming.  He didn't think I'd actually let you go, did you?  He didn't think I'd let you go that easy.  Did you lose her?  How much do you think I should make this check out for?  Let's see, where your bill was 20 bucks.  So technically, you left more than 20 percent, but it's...  See, the thing is, is when you go into a place like Hooners and you have hot girls like me serving you,  you should know that we demand a lot more than 20 percent retard.  You think I'd flirt with you all night for fun?  You don't think that I go and talk to all my friends about what a loser and how pathetic you are.  We'll guess what retard I do.  And all my friends and I talked about you last night and they all agreed that this is exactly what I should do.  I should call you up, get you to invite me to your place and rape your checkbook.  You never thought this would happen to you.  Well guess what loser it's happening right now.  You don't think you're going to say no, are you?  No, no is not in your vocabulary.  Is it loser?  You know, you're just really fucking stupid for even inviting me over.  You think a hot girl like this wants to be with a loser like you, please.  So I have to check over it now, but how much should I make it out for?  Looks like you make pretty good money.  You have a nice dude on, looks like he just came from work.  I just like to see how much I can get out of my customers.  Maybe if I shove my ass in your face a bit more, I can get even more.  Hot loser, hot.  You know what I want to do?  I want to smother your face with my perfect ass and then see you saying no to me.  Because guys thought loser, I know you can't.  You know what I want you to do?  I want you to stick your nose right in there.  Yeah, you like that, don't you?  You know, that's as close to getting it to my ass, right?  Just shove your face right in my ass.  So how much is that going to be, loser?  300?  400?  500?  Well that was easy.  Wasn't that loser?  Now I know what you made.  How about?  I let you jerk off.  You better be.  And while I finish writing this check to myself, you can jack off.  So I'm going to let you count down, okay.  And as soon as I finish writing this check, you better come.  Otherwise that's it.  And you're shit out of luck, loser.  So I'm writing in five hundred.  Better be jackin' off.  Five.  Hundred.  Almost there, loser.  I don't have time to hold your hand.  You got about 10 more seconds, loser.  Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.  Now all you got to do is sign.  Right there, loser.  I'm waiting.  Good boy.  I'm sure I'll be seeing you at who there's real soon.  Bye, loser.  Thank you.",
